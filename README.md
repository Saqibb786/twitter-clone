# Twitter UI Clone - Figma Design to Code

This project is a translation of a Figma design into a fully functional user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design includes three key pages: the homepage, login page, and sign-up page of Twitter. The goal is to closely replicate the design with responsive and interactive elements.

## Features
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensures the design adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Implements the layout, styling, and interactive features from the design.
- **Clean and Structured Code**: Follows best practices to maintain a clean and scalable codebase.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes form validation, buttons, and smooth transitions.

## Pages Included
- **Homepage**: The main landing page of Twitter.
- **Login Page**: A page for users to log into their accounts.
- **Sign-up Page**: A registration page for new users.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure and semantic layout of the pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design implementation.
- **JavaScript**: Basic interactivity and form validation.
